        <h1>Book Recommendations by Mood & Genre</h1>

        <h2>Fantasy Favorites</h2>
        <p>
            Fantasy books are ideal for readers who enjoy immersive worlds, strong character arcs,
            and long-term storytelling. Series like <em>Throne of Glass</em> are popular examples
            because they combine action, magic, and emotional growth across multiple books.
        </p>

        <p>
            Fantasy is especially appealing to readers who enjoy committing to a story over time,
            but there are also standalone fantasy novels for those who prefer a shorter experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Comfort Reads</h2>
        <p>
            Comfort reads are books that feel familiar and reassuring, often returning readers to
            stories they already love. The <em>Harry Potter</em> series is a common example of a
            comfort read because of its nostalgic setting, memorable characters, and sense of warmth.
        </p>

        <p>
            Comfort books are not about discovering something new every time, but about revisiting
            stories that provide emotional safety and relaxation.
        </p>

        <h2>Fast-Paced Reads</h2>
        <p>
            Fast-paced books are perfect for readers who want to stay engaged and finish a book
            quickly. Novels like <em>Autoboyography</em> or other contemporary books are often cited as fast-paced reads because
            of their shorter chapters and strong emotional momentum.
        </p>

        <p>
            These types of books are great for reading slumps or busy schedules when longer or
            slower stories feel overwhelming.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Tip:</strong> Choosing books based on your current mood can make reading feel
            more enjoyable and less like a chore.
